# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

# Transeo Frontend Challenge
Welcome to the Transeo interview process! We're excited to consider you for this role and can't wait to see what type of project you put together for this take-home challenge. You should expect to spend anywhere from 2-6 hours on the project, but we'll give you 7 days to turn it in.

# The Process
This take-home challenge is designed to test a few different things:

- Your ability to work independently on a project when given instructions
- Proficiency in front-end development skills
- Your ability to ask questions as needed

This take-home challenge is **not** meant to test the following things:

- Your ability to write "perfect" code
- Your ability to complete the project as fast as possible
- Your ability to disregard all of your life obligations in order to finish

We're very aware that you have a life outside of this interview process, and we want to be really intentional about how we ask you to spend your time because we know it's valuable. That being said, if you can't finish the entire challenge within the allotted time period, **that's ok** - we place way more importance in how you defend your architecture and stylistic choices than if it was done 100% to spec.

# The Challenge
Your challenge is to build a gif viewing service using the Giphy API. You can find documentation for the Giphy API at https://developers.giphy.com/docs/api#quick-start-guide. You'll need to register for an account and create a development app.

## Getting Started
You should create a new React app using `create-react-app` or something similar to bootstrap the process. **Importantly, please use TypeScript for this project.**

## MVP Requirements
- We ask that you please not use the JavaScript Giphy SDK - we want to see how you interact with a live API without package assistance.
- The page should never reload.
- You should use React Router and/or Redux if you see a need for it - that's your choice.
- Provide a textbox to search for Gifs via keywords.
- Do not server side render the frontend - make your Giphy API calls from the frontend.
- You can use any NPM packages you need except for the Giphy SDK
- The page should be well designed in terms of UI/UX

# Tips
- Use well-structured commits
- Don't overthink the exercise. We value well-built projects over unnecessarily complex or feature-rich submissions.
- Bonus points for unit testing! (Not required at all, though)

# Submitting
- Send a link to your project or a ZIP file in an email to your hiring manager
- That's it!

# Questions
We highly encourage you to ask questions throughout the process if you have them. You can email any questions you have to your engineering hiring manager.

Good luck!
